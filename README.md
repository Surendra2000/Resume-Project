# Portfolio — Surendra Pillimetla

Simple static portfolio built with HTML, Bootstrap and a small custom stylesheet.

How to view

- Open `c:/My Projects/index.html` in your browser.
- Or run a quick static server from the folder:

```bash
cd "c:/My Projects"
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Edit

- Update `index.html` and `styles.css` as needed. The layout is Bootstrap-based for easy tweaks.
